# Sprint 2
GIT REPO: https://github.com/ramyaswetha11/Sprint2_Ramya

Except abstract factory pattern in sprint 1, there are totally 3 new patterns implemented

### Builder Pattern
Shape class implement builder pattern so other class are able to create shape through build pattern.
### Strategy Pattern
Strategy pattern use for mouse mode run() method, this includes IStrategy interface and Context for switching mode.

### Decorator Pattern
In OutlineDecorator class I create a method to outline the list of IShape object(s), since all three shape implement IShape, this allows behavior to be added to an individual shape without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
